## TCGRandomizer
A very basic randomizer of Pokemon TCG (GBC). Work in progress.

It randomizes the following ROM:
* Pok√©mon Trading Card Game (U) [C][!].gbc md5: 219b2cc64e5a052003015d4bd4c622cd

Currently, it randomizes the following:
* HP
* Weaknesses and resistances
* Retreat cost
* The moves across Pokemon cards of the same type are shuffled with an algorithm that accounts for energy requirements.

It distinguishes between 6 types of evolution classes or stages to determine the possible values of HP and retreat cost.

At the moment, the Pokemon TCG ROM detailed above must be in the same directory as the .jar file. Upon executing the .jar file, tcgrandomized.gbc will be generated.

<b>Planned features or tweaks</b>
* Fix wrong Pokemon names showing in the descriptions of the shuffled moves
* GUI
* Further randomization of moves, beyond just shuffling the effects, and randomizing energy requirements and damage. Randomizing the move effects themselves may be a possibility, but turther reverse engineering of the Pokemon TCG duel engine will be necessary first.
* Randomization of types. This is related to the randomization of energy requirements and would require adjusting the decks to keep them type-consistent. 
* Randomization of other misc Pokemon card data.
* Some customizable randomization settings including the option to make the randomization repeatable so that different people can generate the same changes.

Contributions aren't expected but would always be welcome.
