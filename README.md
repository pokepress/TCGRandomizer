## TCGRandomizer
A basic randomizer of Pokemon TCG (GBC), written in Java. Work in progress.

It randomizes the following ROM:
* Pok√©mon Trading Card Game (U) [C][!].gbc md5: 219b2cc64e5a052003015d4bd4c622cd

#### <b>Current features</b>

Currently, it randomizes the following (selectable):
* HP
* Weaknesses and resistances
* Retreat cost
* The moves across Pokemon cards of the same type are shuffled with an algorithm that accounts for energy requirements. Blank moves and Pokemon powers are not shuffled

It distinguishes between 6 types of evolution classes or stages to determine the possible values of HP and retreat cost.

#### <b>Planned features or tweaks</b>

* Fix wrong Pokemon names showing in the descriptions of the shuffled moves
* Further randomization of moves, beyond just shuffling the effects, and randomizing energy requirements and damage. Randomizing the move effects themselves may be a possibility, but further reverse engineering of the Pokemon TCG duel engine will be necessary first.
* Randomization of types. This is related to the randomization of energy requirements and would require adjusting the decks to keep them type-consistent. 
* Randomization of other misc Pokemon card data.
* Some customizable settings including the option to make the randomization repeatable so that different people can generate the same changes.

Contributions aren't expected but would always be welcome.
